# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

## Final Product
1. When a user submits a tweet, the form will submit a new POST request via AJAX using JQuery.
2. An error message will display at the top if no tweet content is present or the tweet is too long.
3. When the width of main page shrinks down to below 1024 px, the page switches layout to enhance readability.
